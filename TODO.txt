Chapter 10:
  confused when the book said attributes might refer to as "fields" in the documentation
  split 10.9 into two sections (create 10.10 about StringBuilder)
  new section on variable scope (static, instance, parameter, local)

Chapter 11:
  need more explanation of "this." (and "that." isn't helpful)
  explain the terms default constructor and value constructor? -- need more on constructors
  show an example of calling each method after it's defined (constructor, equals, toString)
  need to introduce Object before Ch14 (somewhere in Ch10 or Ch11)
  Time.java should not be a Trinket -- running it doesn't "do" anything (are there others?)

Chapter 12:
  include a Trinket somewhere? maybe with printing out the cards?

Chapter 13:
  add more details about UML diagrams (static methods, final attributes)

Chapter 14:
  talk more about packages somewhere near the end of the book?

Chapter 15:
  advanced object-oriented: interfaces, abstract classes, List, simulation?
  instanceof so that assertEquals works if you write your own equals method

Chapter 16:
  working with data: 2D arrays, file I/O, exception handling (e.g., IllegalArgumentException)
  bring back Conway's Game of Life material from V5? or Langton's ant?

Appendix A:
  remove DrJava? (move to online setup instructions)
  update JUnit to Version 4 or 5; explain what deprecated means? (for assertEquals on double)
  move JUnit to Chapter 9 and expand? instead of program development and generalization?
  new section about JaCoCo? new section about JShell?

Appendix B:

Appendix C:
  remove duplicate figure/text in Chapter 10

Appendix D:
  stack trace (how to read)

Appendix E:
  try to eliminate by integrating content back into the main chapters

# spell check main text; ignore code/output/trinket blocks
detex -e code,stdout,trinket thinkjava.tex > thinkjava.txt

# search for URLs; make sure they all work
grep -o '\\url{[^}]*}' *.tex
grep -o '\\href{[^}]*}{[^}]*}' *.tex

# search for escapes in \java; remove from Atlas
grep -no 'java{[^}]*}' *.tex | grep '\\'

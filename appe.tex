\chapter{Extras}
\label{extras}

This appendix contains sections of previous versions of the book.
We chose to remove them from this edition, because they were not essential to meet the chapter goals.
However you may still find this material useful.


%%% Section 6.1 (second half)
\section{Unreachable code}

Sometimes it is convenient to write multiple \java{return} statements, for example, one in each branch of a conditional:

\begin{code}
public static double absoluteValue(double x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        return -x;
    } else {
        return x;
    }
}
\end{code}

Since these \java{return} statements are in a conditional statement, only one will be executed.
As soon as either of them executes, the method terminates without executing any more statements.

\index{dead code}

Code that appears after a \java{return} statement (in the same block), or any place else where it can never be executed, is called {\bf dead code}.
The compiler will give you an ``unreachable statement'' error if part of your code is dead.
For example, this method contains two lines of dead code:

\begin{code}
public static double absoluteValue(double x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        return -x;
        System.out.println("This line is dead.");  // error
    } else {
        return x;
    }
    System.out.println("So is this one.");  // error
}
\end{code}

If you put \java{return} statements inside a conditional statement, you have to make sure that {\em every possible path} through the method reaches a \java{return} statement.
The compiler will let you know if that's not the case.
For example, the following method is incomplete:

\begin{code}
public static double absoluteValue(double x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        return -x;
    } else if (x > 0) {
        return x;
    }
    // error: missing return statement
}
\end{code}

When \java{x} is 0, neither condition is true, so the method ends without hitting a return statement.
The error message in this case might be something like ``missing return statement'', which is confusing since there are already two.

Compiler errors like ``unreachable statement'' and ``missing return statement'' often indicate a problem with your algorithm, not the code.
In the previous example, \java{if (x > 0)} is unnecessary because \java{x} will always be positive or zero at that point.
Changing that \java{else if} to an \java{else} resolves the error.


%%% Section 6.5
\section{Boolean methods}

\index{boolean}
\index{method!boolean}

Methods can return \java{boolean} values, just like any other type, which is often convenient for hiding tests inside methods.
For example:

\begin{code}
public static boolean isSingleDigit(int x) {
    if (x > -10 && x < 10) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
\end{code}

The name of this method is \java{isSingleDigit}.
It is common to give \java{boolean} methods names that sound like yes/no questions.
Since the return type is \java{boolean}, the return statement has to provide a boolean expression.

The code itself is straightforward, although it is longer than it needs to be.
Remember that the expression \java{x > -10 && x < 10} has type \java{boolean}, so there is nothing wrong with returning it directly (without the \java{if} statement):

\begin{code}
public static boolean isSingleDigit(int x) {
    return x > -10 && x < 10;
}
\end{code}

In \java{main}, you can invoke the method in the usual ways:

\begin{code}
System.out.println(isSingleDigit(2));
boolean bigFlag = !isSingleDigit(17);
\end{code}

The first line displays \java{true} because 2 is a single-digit number.
The second line sets \java{bigFlag} to \java{true}, because 17 is {\em not} a single-digit number.

Conditional statements often invoke \java{boolean} methods and use the result as the condition:

\begin{code}
if (isSingleDigit(z)) {
    System.out.println("z is small");
} else {
    System.out.println("z is big");
}
\end{code}

Examples like this one almost read like English:
``If is single digit z, print ... else print ...''.


%%% Section 7.6
\section{The do-while loop}

\index{pretest loop}

The \java{while} and \java{for} statements are {\bf pretest loops}; that is, they test the condition first and at the beginning of each pass through the loop.

\index{posttest loop}
\index{do-while}

Java also provides a {\bf posttest loop}: the \java{do}-\java{while} statement.
This type of loop is useful when you need to run the body of the loop at least once.

%NOTE: can we find an example that's better using do-while than using while-break?

For example, in Section~\ref{validate} we used the \java{return} statement to avoid reading invalid input from the user.
We can use a \java{do}-\java{while} loop to keep reading input until it's valid:

\begin{code}
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
boolean okay;
do {
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    if (in.hasNextDouble()) {
        okay = true;
    } else {
        okay = false;
        String word = in.next();
        System.err.println(word + " is not a number");
    }
} while (!okay);
double x = in.nextDouble();
\end{code}

Although this code looks complicated, it is essentially only three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Display a prompt.
\item Check the input; if invalid, display an error and start over.
\item Read the input.
\end{enumerate}

\index{System.err}

The code uses a flag variable, \java{okay}, to indicate whether we need to repeat the loop body.
If \java{hasNextDouble()} returns \java{false}, we consume the invalid input by calling \java{next()}.
We then display an error message via \java{System.err}.
The loop terminates when \java{hasNextDouble()} return \java{true}.


%%% Section 7.7
\section{Break and continue}

Sometimes neither a pretest nor a posttest loop will provide exactly what you need.
In the previous example, the ``test'' needed to happen in the middle of the loop.
As a result, we used a flag variable and a nested \java{if}-\java{else} statement.

\index{break}

A simpler way to solve this problem is to use a \java{break} statement.
When a program reaches a \java{break} statement, it exits the current loop.

\begin{code}
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
while (true) {
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    if (in.hasNextDouble()) {
        break;
    }
    String word = in.next();
    System.err.println(word + " is not a number");
}
double x = in.nextDouble();
\end{code}

Using \java{true} as a conditional in a \java{while} loop is an idiom that means ``loop forever'', or in this case ``loop until you get to a \java{break} statement.''

\index{continue}

In addition to the \java{break} statement, which exits the loop, Java provides a \java{continue} statement that moves on to the next iteration.
For example, the following code reads integers from the keyboard and computes a running total.
The \java{continue} statement causes the program to skip over any negative values.

\begin{code}
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int x = -1;
int sum = 0;
while (x != 0) {
    x = in.nextInt();
    if (x <= 0) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println("Adding " + x);
    sum += x;
}
\end{code}

Although \java{break} and \java{continue} statements give you more control of the loop execution, they can make code difficult to understand and debug.
Use them sparingly.

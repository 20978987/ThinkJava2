\index{method!value}
\index{method!void}
\index{value method}
\index{void method}

Some of the methods we have used, like the \java{Math} methods, return values.
But all the methods we have {\em written} so far have been \java{void}; that is, they don't return values.
In this chapter, we'll write methods that return values, which we call {\bf value methods}.


\section{Recursive methods}
\label{recursion}

\index{recursion}

Now that we have conditional statements, we can explore one of the most magical things a program can do: {\bf recursion}.
Consider the following example:

\begin{code}
public static void countdown(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        System.out.println("Blastoff!");
    } else {
        System.out.println(n);
        countdown(n - 1);
    }
}
\end{code}

\index{recursive}

The name of the method is \java{countdown}; it takes a single integer as a parameter.
If the parameter is zero, it displays the word ``Blastoff''.
Otherwise, it displays the number and then invokes {\em itself}, passing \java{n - 1} as the argument.
A method that invokes itself is called {\bf recursive}.

What happens if we invoke \java{countdown(3)} from \java{main}?

\vspace{-1ex}
\begin{quote}
The execution of \java{countdown} begins with \java{n == 3}, and since \java{n} is not zero, it displays the value 3, and then invokes itself...
\begin{quote}
The execution of \java{countdown} begins with \java{n == 2}, and since \java{n} is not zero, it displays the value 2, and then invokes itself...
\begin{quote}
The execution of \java{countdown} begins with \java{n == 1}, and since \java{n} is not zero, it displays the value 1, and then invokes itself...
\begin{quote}
The execution of \java{countdown} begins with \java{n == 0}, and since \java{n} is zero, it displays the word ``Blastoff!'' and then returns.
\end{quote}
The \java{countdown} that got \java{n == 1} returns.
\end{quote}
The \java{countdown} that got \java{n == 2} returns.
\end{quote}
The \java{countdown} that got \java{n == 3} returns.
\end{quote}
\vspace{-1ex}

And then you're back in \java{main}.
So the total output looks like:

\begin{stdout}
3
2
1
Blastoff!
\end{stdout}

As a second example, we'll rewrite the methods \java{newLine} and \java{threeLine} from Section~\ref{adding_methods}.

\begin{code}
public static void newLine() {
    System.out.println();
}

public static void threeLine() {
    newLine();
    newLine();
    newLine();
}
\end{code}

\index{newline}

Although these methods work, they would not help if we wanted to display two newlines, or maybe 100.
A better alternative would be:

\begin{code}
public static void nLines(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        System.out.println();
        nLines(n - 1);
    }
}
\end{code}

This method takes an integer, \java{n}, as a parameter and displays \java{n} newlines.
The structure is similar to \java{countdown}.
As long as $n$ is greater than zero, it displays a newline and then invokes itself to display $(n-1)$ additional newlines.
The total number of newlines is $1 + (n - 1)$, which is just what we wanted: $n$.


\section{Recursive stack diagrams}

\index{stack diagram}
\index{diagram!stack}

In the previous chapter, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a method invocation.
The same kind of diagram can make it easier to interpret a recursive method.

Remember that every time a method gets called, Java creates a new frame that contains the current method's parameters and variables.
Figure~\ref{fig.stack2} is a stack diagram for \java{countdown}, called with \java{n == 3}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figs/stack2.pdf}
\caption{Stack diagram for the \java{countdown} program.}
\label{fig.stack2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

By convention, the stack for \java{main} is at the top and the stack grows down.
The frame for \java{main} is empty because \java{main} does not have any variables.
(It has the parameter \java{args}, but since we're not using it, we left it out of the diagram.)

\index{base case}

There are four frames for \java{countdown}, each with a different value for the parameter \java{n}.
The last frame, with \java{n == 0}, is called the {\bf base case}.
It does not make a recursive call, so there are no more frames below it.

If there is no base case in a recursive method, or if the base case is never reached, the stack would grow forever, at least in theory.
In practice, the size of the stack is limited; if you exceed the limit, you get a \java{StackOverflowError}.

For example, here is a recursive method without a base case:

\begin{code}
public static void forever(String s) {
    System.out.println(s);
    forever(s);
}
\end{code}

\index{call stack}
\index{stack overflow}

This method displays the string until the stack overflows, at which point it throws an exception.


\section{Binary numbers}

The \java{countdown} example has three parts: (1) it checks the base case, (2) displays something, and (3) makes a recursive call.
What do you think happens if you reverse steps 2 and 3, making the recursive call {\em before} displaying?

\begin{code}
public static void countup(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        System.out.println("Blastoff!");
    } else {
        countup(n - 1);
        System.out.println(n);
    }
}
\end{code}

The stack diagram is the same as before, and the method is still called $n$ times.
But now the \java{System.out.println} happens just before each recursive call returns.
As a result, it counts up instead of down:

\begin{stdout}
Blastoff!
1
2
3
\end{stdout}

\index{binary}

This behavior comes in handy when it is easier to compute results in reverse order.
For example, to convert a decimal integer into its {\bf binary} representation, you repeatedly divide the number by two:

\begin{stdout}
23 / 2 is 11 remainder 1
11 / 2 is  5 remainder 1
 5 / 2 is  2 remainder 1
 2 / 2 is  1 remainder 0
 1 / 2 is  0 remainder 1
\end{stdout}

Reading these remainders from bottom to top, 23 in binary is 10111.
For more background about binary numbers, see \url{http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html}.

Here is a recursive method that displays the binary representation of any positive integer:

\begin{code}
public static void displayBinary(int value) {
    if (value > 0) {
        displayBinary(value / 2);
        System.out.print(value % 2);
    }
}
\end{code}

If \java{value} is zero, \java{displayBinary} does nothing (that's the base case).
If the argument is positive, the method divides it by two and calls \java{displayBinary} recursively.
When the recursive call returns, the method displays one digit of the result and returns (again).

The leftmost digit is at the bottom of the stack, so it gets displayed first.
The rightmost digit, at the top of the stack, gets displayed last.
After invoking \java{displayBinary}, we use \java{println} to complete the output.

\begin{code}
displayBinary(23);
System.out.println();
// output is 10111
\end{code}

Learning to think recursively is an important aspect of learning to think like a computer scientist.
Many algorithms can be written concisely with recursive methods that perform computations on the way down, on the way up, or both.


\section{More recursion}
\label{factorial}

\index{Turing complete}
\index{language!complete}

\index{Turing, Alan}
\index{Church, Alonzo}

Now that we have methods that return values, we have a {\bf Turing complete} programming language.
That means Java can compute anything computable, for any reasonable definition of ``computable''.
This idea was developed by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, so it is known as the Church-Turing thesis.
%You can read more about it at \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_thesis}.

\index{recursion}

To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools we have learned, let's look at some methods for evaluating recursively-defined mathematical functions.
A recursive definition is similar to a circular definition, in the sense that the definition refers to the thing being defined.

Of course, a truly circular definition is not very useful:

\begin{description}
\term{recursive} An adjective used to describe a method that is recursive.
\end{description}

If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed.
But if you search for recursion on Google, it displays ``Did you mean: recursion'' as an inside joke.

\index{factorial}

Many mathematical functions are defined recursively, because that is often the simplest way.
For example, the {\bf factorial} of an integer $n$, which is written $n!$, is defined like this:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&  0! = 1 \\
&&  n! = n \cdot(n-1)!
\end{eqnarray*}

Don't confuse the mathematical symbol $!$, which means {\em factorial}, with the Java operator \java{!}, which means {\em not}.
This definition says that \java{factorial(0)} is \java{1}, and that \java{factorial(n)} is \java{n * factorial(n - 1)}.

So \java{factorial(3)} is \java{3 * factorial(2)}; \java{factorial(2)} is \java{2 * factorial(1)}; \java{factorial(1)} is \java{1 * factorial(0)}; and \java{factorial(0)} is \java{1}.
Putting it all together, we get \java{3 * 2 * 1 * 1}, which is 6.

If you can formulate a recursive definition of something, you can easily write a Java method to evaluate it.
The first step is to decide what the parameters and return type are.
Since factorial is defined for integers, the method takes an \java{int} as a parameter and returns an \java{int}.
So here's a good starting place:

\begin{code}
public static int factorial(int n) {
    return 0;
}
\end{code}

Next, we think about the base case.
If the argument happens to be zero, we return 1.

\begin{code}
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
\end{code}

Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to find the factorial of $n-1$, and then multiply it by $n$.

\begin{code}
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    int recurse = factorial(n - 1);
    int result = n * recurse;
    return result;
}
\end{code}

The flow of execution for this program is similar to \java{countdown} from Section~\ref{recursion}.
If we invoke \java{factorial} with the value 3:

\vspace{-1ex}
\begin{quote}
Since 3 is not zero, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of $n-1$...
\begin{quote}
Since 2 is not zero, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of $n-1$...
\begin{quote}
Since 1 is not zero, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of $n-1$...
\begin{quote}
Since 0 {\em is} zero, we take the first branch and return the value 1 immediately.
% without making any more recursive invocations.
\end{quote}
The return value (1) gets multiplied by \java{n}, which is 1, and the result is returned.
\end{quote}
The return value (1) gets multiplied by \java{n}, which is 2, and the result is returned.
\end{quote}
The return value (2) gets multiplied by \java{n}, which is 3, and the result, 6, is returned to whatever invoked \java{factorial(3)}.
\end{quote}
\vspace{-1ex}

\index{stack}
\index{diagram!stack}

Figure~\ref{fig.stack3} shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of method invocations.
The return values are shown being passed back up the stack.
Notice that \java{recurse} and \java{result} do not exist in the last frame, because when \java{n == 0} the code that declares them does not execute.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{fig.stack3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{Leap of faith}
\label{leap of faith}

\index{leap of faith}

Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become overwhelming.
An alternative is the {\bf leap of faith}:
when you come to a method invocation, instead of following the flow of execution, you {\em assume} that the method works correctly and returns the appropriate value.

In fact, you are already practicing a leap of faith when you use methods in the Java library.
When you invoke \java{Math.cos} or \java{System.out.println}, you don't examine the implementations of those methods.
You just assume that they work properly.

You should apply the same reasoning to your own methods.
For example, in Section~\ref{boolean} we wrote a method called \java{isSingleDigit} that determines whether a number is between 0 and 9.
Once we convince ourselves that this method is correct -- by testing and examination of the code -- we can use the method without ever looking at the implementation again.

The same is true of recursive methods.
When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution you should {\em assume} that the recursive invocation works.
For example, ``Assuming that I can find the factorial of $n-1$, can I compute the factorial of $n$?''
Yes you can, by multiplying by $n$.

Of course, it is strange to assume that the method works correctly when you have not finished writing it, but that's why it's called a leap of faith!


\section{One more example}
\label{fibonacci}

\index{fibonacci}

Another common recursively-defined mathematical function is the Fibonacci sequence, which has the following definition:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& fibonacci(1) = 1 \\
&& fibonacci(2) = 1 \\
&& fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
\end{eqnarray*}

Translated into Java, this function is:

\begin{code}
public static int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
        return 1;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
\end{code}

If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for small values of \java{n}, your head will explode.
But if we take a leap of faith and assume that the two recursive invocations work correctly, it is clear that their sum is the result.

\section{Exercises}

The code for this chapter is in the {\tt ch08} directory of {\tt ThinkJava2Code}.
See page~\pageref{code} for instructions on how to download the repository.
Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.

If you have not already read Appendix~\ref{JUnit}, now might be a good time.
It describes JUnit, a tool for efficiently testing value methods.


\begin{exercise}

If you have a question about whether something is legal, and what happens if it is not, a good way to find out is to ask the compiler.
Answer the following questions by trying them out.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What happens if you invoke a value method and don't do anything with the result; that is, if you don't assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression?

\item What happens if you use a void method as part of an expression?
For example, try \java{System.out.println("boo!") + 7;}

\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{ex.isdiv}

Write a method named \java{isDivisible} that takes two integers, \java{n} and \java{m}, and that returns \java{true} if \java{n} is divisible by \java{m}, and \java{false} otherwise.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle.
For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are one inch long, you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle.
For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, you cannot form a triangle.
\end{quotation}

Write a method named \java{isTriangle} that takes three integers as arguments and returns either \java{true} or \java{false}, depending on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the given lengths.
The point of this exercise is to use conditional statements to write a value method.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{ex.multadd}

Many computations can be expressed more concisely using the ``multadd'' operation, which takes three operands and computes \java{a * b + c}.
Some processors even provide a hardware implementation of this operation for floating-point numbers.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Create a new program called {\tt Multadd.java}.

\item Write a method called \java{multadd} that takes three \java{doubles} as parameters and that returns \java{a * b + c}.

\item Write a \java{main} method that tests \java{multadd} by invoking it with a few simple parameters, like \java{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}.

\item Also in \java{main}, use \java{multadd} to compute the following values:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
& \sin \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\cos \frac{\pi}{4}}{2} & \\
& \log 10 + \log 20 &
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Write a method called \java{expSum} that takes a double as a parameter and that uses \java{multadd} to calculate:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
x e^{-x} + \sqrt{1 - e^{-x}}
\end{eqnarray*}
%
{\it Hint:} The method for raising $e$ to a power is \java{Math.exp}.

\end{enumerate}

In the last part of this exercise, you need to write a method that invokes another method you wrote.
Whenever you do that, it is a good idea to test the first method carefully before working on the second.
Otherwise, you might find yourself debugging two methods at the same time, which can be difficult.

One of the purposes of this exercise is to practice pattern-matching: the ability to recognize a specific problem as an instance of a general category of problems.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

What is the output of the following program?

\begin{code}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean flag1 = isHoopy(202);
    boolean flag2 = isFrabjuous(202);
    System.out.println(flag1);
    System.out.println(flag2);
    if (flag1 && flag2) {
        System.out.println("ping!");
    }
    if (flag1 || flag2) {
        System.out.println("pong!");
    }
}
\end{code}

\begin{code}
public static boolean isHoopy(int x) {
    boolean hoopyFlag;
    if (x % 2 == 0) {
        hoopyFlag = true;
    } else {
        hoopyFlag = false;
    }
    return hoopyFlag;
}
\end{code}

\begin{code}
public static boolean isFrabjuous(int x) {
    boolean frabjuousFlag;
    if (x > 0) {
        frabjuousFlag = true;
    } else {
        frabjuousFlag = false;
    }
    return frabjuousFlag;
}
\end{code}

The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you understand logical operators and the flow of execution through value methods.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

In this exercise, you will use a stack diagram to understand the execution of the following recursive program.

\begin{code}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(prod(1, 4));
}

public static int prod(int m, int n) {
    if (m == n) {
        return n;
    } else {
        int recurse = prod(m, n - 1);
        int result = n * recurse;
        return result;
    }
}
\end{code}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Draw a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before the last invocation of \java{prod} completes.

\item What is the output of this program?
(Try to answer this question on paper first, then run the code to check your answer.)

\item Explain in a few words what \java{prod} does (without getting into the details of how it works).

\item Rewrite \java{prod} without the temporary variables \java{recurse} and \java{result}.
{\it Hint:} You only need one line for the \java{else} branch.

\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Write a recursive method named \java{oddSum} that takes a positive odd integer \java{n} and returns the sum of odd integers from 1 to n.
Start with a base case, and use temporary variables to debug your solution.
You might find it helpful to print the value of \java{n} each time \java{oddSum} is invoked.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

The goal of this exercise is to translate a recursive definition into a Java method.
The Ackermann function is defined for non-negative integers as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
A(m, n) = \begin{cases}
              n+1 & \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
        A(m-1, 1) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n > 0
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray*}

Write a method called \java{ack} that takes two \java{int}s as parameters and that computes and returns the value of the Ackermann function.

Test your implementation of Ackermann by invoking it from \java{main} and displaying the return value.
Note the return value gets very big very quickly.
You should try it only for small values of $m$ and $n$ (not bigger than 3).

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{ex.power}

Write a recursive method called \java{power} that takes a double \java{x} and an integer \java{n} and returns $x^n$.

{\it Hint:} A recursive definition of this operation is $x^n = x \cdot x^{n-1}$.
Also, remember that anything raised to the zeroth power is 1.

Optional challenge: you can make this method more efficient, when \java{n} is even, using $x^n = \left( x^{n/2} \right)^2$.

\end{exercise}

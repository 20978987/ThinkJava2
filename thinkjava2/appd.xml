  <title>Compile-Time Errors</title>
    <para>The best kind of debugging is the kind you don’t have to do because you avoid making errors in the first place. Incremental development, which we presented in <xref linkend="distance"/>, can help. The key is to start with a working program and add small amounts of code at a time. When there is an error, you will have a pretty good idea where it is. </para><para>Nevertheless, you might find yourself in one of the following situations. For each situation, we have some suggestions about how to proceed. </para><sect2 id="a0000013930" remap="subsection">

</indexterm>If the compiler reports 100 error messages, that doesn’t mean there are 100 errors in your program. When the compiler encounters an error, it often gets thrown off track for a while. It tries to recover and pick up again after the first error, but sometimes it reports spurious errors. </para><para>Only the first error message is truly reliable. We suggest that you only fix one error at a time, and then recompile the program. You may find that one semicolon or brace “fixes” 100 errors. </para>

  <title>I’m getting a weird compiler message, and it won’t go away.</title>
    <para>First of all, read the error message carefully.

  <title>I found the bug!</title>
    <para>When you find the bug, it is usually obvious how to fix it. But not always. Sometimes what seems to be a bug is really an indication that you don’t understand the program, or there is an error in your algorithm. In these cases, you might have to rethink the algorithm, or adjust your mental model. Take some time away from the computer to think, work through test cases by hand, or draw diagrams to represent the computation. </para><para>After you fix the bug, don’t just start in making new errors. Take a minute to think about what kind of bug it was, why you made the error, how the error manifested itself, and what you could have done to find it faster. Next time you see something similar, you will be able to find the bug more quickly. Or even better, you will learn to avoid that type of bug for good. </para></sect2>

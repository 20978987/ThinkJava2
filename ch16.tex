\index{inheritance}
\index{generalization}

When we first looked at inheritance in Chapter~\ref{eights}, our purpose was to avoid duplicating code.
We noticed that ``decks of cards'' and ``hands of cards'' had common functionality, and we designed a \java{CardCollection} class to provide it.
This technique is an example of {\bf generalization}.
By generalizing the code, we were able to reuse it in the \java{Deck} and \java{Hand} classes.

\index{specialization}

In Chapter~\ref{conway}, we looked at inheritance from a different point of view.
When designing \java{GridCanvas} to represent a grid of cells, we extended \java{Canvas} and overrode its \java{paint} and \java{update} methods.
This design is an example of {\bf specialization}.
Using the code provided by \java{Canvas}, we created a specialized subclass with minimal additional code.

We didn't write the code for \java{Canvas}; it's part of the Java Library.
But we were able to customize it for our own purposes.
In fact, the \java{Canvas} class was explicitly designed to be extended.

In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of inheritance more fully and explore event-driven programming.
We'll continue to develop graphical simulations as a running example, but this time in varying shapes and colors!


\section{Polygon Objects}

The word polygon means ``many angles''; the most basic polygons are triangles (3 angles), rectangles (4 angles), pentagons (5 angles), and so forth.
Polygons are an important part of computer graphics because they are used to compose more complex images.

Java provides a \java{Polygon} class (in \java{java.awt}) that we can use to represent and draw polygons.
The following code creates an empty \java{Polygon} and adds three points.

\begin{code}
Polygon p = new Polygon();
p.addPoint(57, 110);
p.addPoint(100, 35);
p.addPoint(143, 110);
\end{code}

Internally, \java{Polygon} objects have three attributes:

\begin{itemize}

\item \java{public int npoints;} {\tt ~~~} \java{// total number of points}

\item \java{public int[] xpoints;} {\tt ~} \java{// array of X coordinates}

\item \java{public int[] ypoints;} {\tt ~} \java{// array of Y coordinates}

\end{itemize}

When a \java{Polygon} is created, \java{npoints} is 0 and the two arrays are initialized with length 4.
As points are added, \java{npoints} is incremented.
If \java{npoints} exceeds the length of the arrays, larger arrays are created, and the previous values are copied over (similar to how \java{ArrayList} works).

The \java{Polygon} class provides many useful methods, like \java{contains}, \java{intersects}, and \java{translate}.
We'll get to those later, but first we're going to do some specialization.


\section{Adding Color}

Specialization is useful for adding new features to an existing class, especially when you can't (or don't want to) change its design.
For example, we can extend the \java{Polygon} class by adding a \java{Color} attribute and implementing a \java{draw} method:

\begin{code}
public class ColorPolygon extends Polygon {
    protected Color color;

    public ColorPolygon() {
        super();
        color = Color.GRAY;
    }
    
    public void draw(Graphics g) {
        g.setColor(color);
        g.fillPolygon(this);
    }
}
\end{code}

As a reminder, constructors are not inherited when you extend a class.
If you don't define a constructor, the compiler will generate one that does nothing.

The constructor for \java{ColorPolygon} uses \java{super} to invoke the constructor for \java{Polygon}, which initializes the attributes \java{npoints}, \java{xpoints}, and \java{ypoints}.
Then \java{ColorPolygon} initializes the \java{color} attribute to \java{GRAY}.

\java{ColorPolygon} has the same attributes and methods that \java{Polygon} has, so you can use \java{addPoint} as before, or you can directly access \java{npoints}, \java{xpoints}, and \java{ypoints} (since they are \java{public}).
You can also use methods like \java{contains}, \java{intersects}, and \java{translate}.

The following code creates a \java{ColorPolygon} with the same points as in the previous section, and sets its color to \java{GREEN}:

\begin{code}
ColorPolygon p = new ColorPolygon();
p.addPoint(57, 110);
p.addPoint(100, 35);
p.addPoint(143, 110);
p.color = Color.GREEN;
\end{code}


\section{Regular Polygons}

A ``regular'' polygon has all sides the same length and all angles equal in measure.
Regular polygons are a special case of polygons, so we will use specialization to define a class for them.

We could extend the \java{Polygon} class, like we did in the previous section.
But then we would not have the \java{Color} functionality we just added.
So we will make \java{RegularPolygon} extend \java{ColorPolygon}.

To construct a \java{RegularPolygon}, we specify the number of sides, the radius (distance from the center to a vertex), and the color.
For example:

\begin{code}
RegularPolygon rp = new RegularPolygon(6, 50, Color.BLUE);
\end{code}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figs/hexagon.pdf}
\caption{Determining the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of vertex V1, given the radius~$r$ and angle~$\theta$. The center of the polygon is at the origin $(0, 0)$.}
\label{fig:hexagon}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The constructor uses trigonometry to find the coordinates of each vertex.
Figure~\ref{fig:hexagon} illustrates the process.
The number of sides ($n=6$) and the radius ($r=50$) are given as parameters.

\begin{itemize}

\item Imagine a clock hand starting at V0 and rotating counterclockwise to V1, V2, and so forth.
In Figure~\ref{fig:hexagon}, the hand is currently at V1.

\item The angle $\theta$ is $2 \pi / n$, since there are $2\pi$ radians in a circle.
In other words, we are dividing the rotation of the clock hand into $n$ equal angles.

\item By definition, $\cos(\theta) = x/r$ and $\sin(\theta) = y/r$. Therefore, $x = r \cos(\theta)$ and $y = r \sin(\theta)$.

\item We can determine the other $(x, y)$ coordinates by multiplying $\theta$ by $i$, where $i$ is the vertex number.

\end{itemize}

Here is the contructor for \java{RegularPolygon}:

\begin{code}
public RegularPolygon(int nsides, int radius, Color color) {

    // initialize ColorPolygon attributes
    this.npoints = nsides;
    this.xpoints = new int[nsides];
    this.ypoints = new int[nsides];
    this.color = color;

    // the amount to rotate for each vertex (in radians)
    double theta = 2.0 * Math.PI / nsides;

    // compute x and y coordinates, centered at the origin
    for (int i = 0; i < nsides; i++) {
        double x = radius * Math.cos(i * theta);
        double y = radius * Math.sin(i * theta);
        xpoints[i] = (int) Math.round(x);
        ypoints[i] = (int) Math.round(y);
    }
}
\end{code}

This constructor initializes all four attributes, so it doesn't have to invoke \java{super()}.

It initializes \java{xpoints} and \java{ypoints} by creating arrays of \java{int}.
Inside the \java{for} loop, it uses \java{sin} and \java{cos} to compute the coordinates of the vertices as floating-point numbers, then it rounds them off to integers, and stores them in the arrays.

When we construct a \java{RegularPolygon}, the vertices are centered around the point $(0, 0)$.
If we want the center of the polygon to be somewhere else, we can use \java{translate}, which we inherit from \java{Polygon}:

\begin{code}
RegularPolygon rp = new RegularPolygon(6, 50, Color.BLUE);
rp.translate(100, 100);
\end{code}

The result is a polygon with radius 50 centered at the point $(100, 100)$.


\section{More Constructors}

Java Library classes, including \java{Polygon}, often have more than one constructor for convenience.
For example, we could make the \java{color} parameter optional by defining a second constructor:

\begin{code}
public RegularPolygon(int nsides, int radius) {
    this(nsides, radius, Color.GRAY);
}
\end{code}

The keyword \java{this}, when used in a constructor, invokes another constructor in the same class.
It has a similar syntax as the keyword \java{super}, which invokes a constructor in the superclass.

Similarly, we could make the \java{radius} parameter optional too:

\begin{code}
public RegularPolygon(int nsides) {
    this(nsides, 50);
}
\end{code}

Now, suppose we invoke the \java{RegularPolygon} constructor like this:

\begin{code}
RegularPolygon rp = new RegularPolygon(6);
\end{code}

Because we provide one integer argument, Java calls the third constructor, which calls the second one, which calls the first one.
The result is a \java{RegularPolygon} with the specified value of \java{nsides}, 6, the default value of \java{radius}, 50, and the default color, \java{BLACK}.

When writing constructors, it's a good idea to validate the values you get as parameters.
Doing so prevents run-time errors from happening later in the program, which makes the code easier to debug.

For \java{RegularPolygon}, the number of sides should be at least three, the radius should be greater than zero, and the color should not be null.
We can add the following lines to the first constructor:

\begin{code}
public RegularPolygon(int nsides, int radius, Color color) {

    // validate the arguments
    if (nsides < 3) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("invalid nsides");
    }
    if (radius <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("invalid radius");
    }
    if (color == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("invalid color");
    }
    
    // the rest of the method is omitted
\end{code}

\index{throw}
\index{Statement!throw}

In this example, we \java{throw} an exception to indicate that an error happened.
Exceptions that are not caught (with \java{try}/\java{catch}) automatically terminate the program and display an error message along with the stack trace.

Because we added this code to the most general constructor, we don't have to add it to the others.


\section{An Initial Drawing}
\label{sec:drawing}

Now that we have \java{ColorPolygon} and \java{RegularPolygon}, let's take them for a test drive.
We'll need a \java{Canvas} for drawing them, so we define a new class, \java{Drawing}, that extends \java{Canvas}:

\begin{code}
public class Drawing extends Canvas {
    private ArrayList<ColorPolygon> list;

    public Drawing(int width, int height) {
        setSize(width, height);
        setBackground(Color.WHITE);
        list = new ArrayList<ColorPolygon>();
    }

    public void add(ColorPolygon cp) {
        list.add(cp);
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        for (ColorPolygon cp : list) {
            cp.draw(g);
        }
    }
}
\end{code}

\java{Drawing} has an \java{ArrayList} of \java{ColorPolygon} objects.
When we create a \java{Drawing} object, the list is initially empty.
The \java{add} method takes a \java{ColorPolygon} and adds it to the list.

\java{Drawing} overrides the \java{paint} method it inherits from \java{Canvas}.
\java{paint} loops through the list of \java{ColorPolygon} objects and invokes \java{draw} on each one.

Here is an example that creates three \java{RegularPolygon} objects and draws them.
Figure~\ref{fig:drawing} shows the result.

\begin{code}
public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create some regular polygons
    ColorPolygon p1 = new RegularPolygon(3, 50, Color.GREEN);
    ColorPolygon p2 = new RegularPolygon(6, 50, Color.ORANGE);
    ColorPolygon p3 = new RegularPolygon(360, 50, Color.BLUE);

    // move them out of the corner
    p1.translate(100, 80);
    p2.translate(250, 120);
    p3.translate(400, 160);

    // create drawing, add polygons
    Drawing drawing = new Drawing(500, 250);
    drawing.add(p1);
    drawing.add(p2);
    drawing.add(p3);

    // set up the window frame
    JFrame frame = new JFrame("Drawing");
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    frame.add(drawing);
    frame.pack();
    frame.setVisible(true);
}
\end{code}

The first block of code creates \java{RegularPolygon} objects with 3, 6, and 360 sides.
As you'll see, a polygon with 360 sides is a pretty good approximation of a circle.

The next block of code translates the polygons to different locations.

The next block of code creates the \java{Drawing} and add the polygons to it.

And the final block of code creates a \java{JFrame}, adds the \java{Drawing} to it, and displays the result.

Most of these pieces should be familiar, but there is one part of this program that might surprise you: when we create the \java{RegularPolygon} objects, we assign them to \java{ColorPolygon} variables, and then pass them to \java{Drawing.add}, which requires \java{ColorPolygon} objects.
It might not be obvious why that's legal.

\index{IS-A}

Recall that \java{RegularPolygon} extends \java{ColorPolygon}, so every \java{RegularPolygon} object is also a \java{ColorPolygon}.

The parameter of \java{Drawing.add} has to be a \java{ColorPolygon}, but it can be any type of \java{ColorPolygon}, which means any subclass of \java{ColorPolygon}.

\index{polymorphism}

This design is an example of {\bf polymorphism}, a fancy word that means ``having many forms''.

%At compile-time, \java{p1} is treated like a \java{ColorPolygon}.
%But at run-time, \java{p1} is actually a \java{RegularPolygon}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{figs/drawing.png}
\caption{Initial drawing of three \java{RegularPolygon} objects.}
\label{fig:drawing}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%What's interesting about this example is that the polygon objects have methods from multiple classes.
%The constructor is defined in \java{RegularPolygon}.
%The \java{translate} method is defined in \java{Polygon}.
%The \java{draw} method (called by \java{paint}) is defined in \java{ColorPolygon}.
%And yet, everything works together seamlessly.


\section{Blinking Polygons}
\label{sec:blinking}

At this point, we have a simple program that draws polygons; we can make it more fun by adding animation.
Chapter~\ref{conway} introduced the idea of simulating time steps.
We can write a simulation loop like this:

\begin{code}
    public static void mainloop(Drawing drawing) {
        // main simulation loop
        while (true) {

            // update the drawing
            drawing.step();

            // delay the simulation
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000 / 30);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // do nothing
            }
        }
    }
\end{code}

The \java{step} method of \java{Drawing} updates each polygon and repaints (clears and redraws) the canvas.

\begin{code}
# class Drawing

public void step() {
    for (ColorPolygon cp : list) {
        cp.step();
    }
    repaint();
}
\end{code}

In order for this code to compile, \java{ColorPolygon} also needs a \java{step} method.
It doesn't need to do anything yet; we'll override it in subclasses.

\begin{code}
public void step() {
    // do nothing
}
\end{code}

Let's design a new type of polygon that blinks.
\java{BlinkingPolygon} will add two more attributes to \java{RegularPolygon}: whether it is currently \java{visible}, and a time step \java{count}.

The constructor initializes these attributes after invoking \java{RegularPolygon}'s constructor (via \java{super}).
Initially, a \java{BlinkingPolygon} is visible, and its time step count is 0.

\begin{code}
public class BlinkingPolygon extends RegularPolygon {
    protected boolean visible;
    protected int count;

    public BlinkingPolygon(int nsides, int radius, Color c) {
        super(nsides, radius, c);
        visible = true;
        count = 0;
    }

    public void draw(Graphics g) {
        if (visible) {
            super.draw(g);
        }
    }

    public void step() {
        count++;
        if (count == 10) {
            count = 0;
            visible = !visible;
        }
    }
}
\end{code}

The \java{draw} method displays the polygon on the screen if it is visible;
otherwise, the polygon is not displayed.
The \java{step} method toggles the visibility flag every ten time steps.

Notice that \java{RegularPolygon}, the superclass, does not have a \java{draw} method.
So \java{super.draw} refers to the \java{draw} method in \java{ColorPolygon}.
%In general, the most recent method up the class hierarchy will be used.

%Replace \java{RegularPolygon} with \java{BlinkingPolygon} in the \java{main} method, and you will see Figure~\ref{fig:drawing} come to life.


\section{Java Interfaces}

You might be getting tired of polygons at this point.
Isn't it possible to draw anything else?
Of course the answer is ``yes'', but our \java{Drawing} is currently based on \java{ColorPolygon}.
In order to draw other types of objects, we'll need to generalize the code further.

The \java{Drawing} class does essentially three things: (1) it maintains a \java{list} of objects, (2) it invokes the \java{draw} method on each object, and (3) it invokes the \java{step} method on each object.
Here's one way to make the code more general:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Define a new superclass, named \java{Actor}, that provides the two methods needed by \java{Drawing}:

\begin{code}
public class Actor {
    public void draw(Graphics g) {
        // do nothing
    }
    public void step() {
        // do nothing
    }
}
\end{code}

\item
In the \java{Drawing} class, find and replace ``\java{ColorPolygon}'' with ``\java{Actor}''.

\item
Any class that we want to draw must now extend \java{Actor} (or one of its subclasses).

\end{enumerate}

There's just one problem: \java{ColorPolygon} already extends \java{Polygon}, and classes may extend only one superclass.
Not to mention that the \java{Actor} class seems pointless, given that it does nothing.

\index{inheritance}

Java provides another mechanism for inheritance that is more appropriate in this situation.
We can define \java{Actor} as an \java{interface} instead of a \java{class}:

\begin{code}
public interface Actor {
    void draw(Graphics g);
    void step();
}
\end{code}

\index{interface}

An {\bf interface} is a list of method declarations that define the capabilities of an object.
All methods are \java{public} by default, since they are intended to be used by other classes.
So there is no need to declare them as \java{public}.

Interfaces use the keyword \java{implements} instead of \java{extends}.
We can change the definition of \java{ColorPolygon} as follows:

\begin{code}
public class ColorPolygon extends Polygon implements Actor
\end{code}

In terms of inheritance, \java{ColorPolygon} is both a \java{Polygon} and an \java{Actor}.
The same is true for subclasses of \java{ColorPolygon}.
As a result, the following statements are now possible:

\begin{code}
Actor a1 = new ColorPolygon();
Actor a2 = new RegularPolygon(5, 50, Color.YELLOW);
Actor a3 = new BlinkingPolygon(8, 50, Color.RED);
\end{code}

\index{polymorphism}

Interfaces are another example of polymorphism.
The variables \java{a1}, \java{a2}, and \java{a3} are all different types of objects.
But each of them provides the \java{draw} and \java{step} methods specified in the \java{Actor} interface.

Classes may extend only one superclass, but they may implement as many interfaces as needed.
Java Library classes often implement multiple interfaces.


\section{Event Listeners}

Now that our \java{Drawing} is based on \java{Actor} instead of \java{ColorPolygon}, we can draw other types of graphics.
Here is the beginning of a class that draws an image file (in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format):

\begin{code}
public class Sprite implements Actor, KeyListener {
    private Image image;
    private int xpos;
    private int ypos;
    private int dx;
    private int dy;

    public Sprite(String path, int xpos, int ypos) {
        try {
            this.image = ImageIO.read(new File(path));
            this.xpos = xpos;
            this.ypos = ypos;
        } catch (IOException exc) {
            exc.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
\end{code}

The constructor attempts to read an image file using \java{ImageIO} (from the \java{javax.imageio} package).
If an error occurs during reading, an \java{IOException} is caught, and the program displays the stack trace for debugging.

\java{Sprite} implements two interfaces: \java{Actor} and \java{KeyListener}.
\java{Actor} requires that we provide \java{draw} and \java{step} methods:

\begin{code}
public void draw(Graphics g) {
    g.drawImage(image, xpos, ypos, null);
}

public void step() {
    xpos += dx;
    ypos += dy;
}
\end{code}

The \java{draw} method draws the image at the sprite's current position.
The \java{step} method changes the position based on \java{dx} and \java{dy}, which are initially zero.

\index{event}

\java{KeyListener} is an interface for receiving keyboard {\bf events}.
It requires you to provide the following methods.
The \java{KeyEvent} argument contains detailed information about which key was pressed, released, or typed.

\begin{itemize}

\item \java{void keyPressed(KeyEvent e);}
\\ Invoked when a key has been ``pressed''.
This method is invoked repeatedly while a key is being held down.

\item \java{void keyReleased(KeyEvent e);}
\\ Invoked when a key has been ``released'', meaning it is no longer down.

\item \java{void keyTyped(KeyEvent e);}
\\ Invoked when a key has been ``typed'', which generally means it has been both pressed and released.

\end{itemize}

We can use these methods to design a simple animation using the arrow keys.
When the user presses up or down, the sprite will change its y-position.
When the user presses left or right, the sprite will change its x-position.

Arrow keys behave differently from letters and numbers on a keyboard.
They generate ``virtual key'' codes, rather than printable characters.
The \java{KeyEvent} class defines constants for referring to these codes.

\begin{code}
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
    switch (e.getKeyCode()) {
        case KeyEvent.VK_UP:
            dy = -5;
            break;
        case KeyEvent.VK_DOWN:
            dy = +5;
            break;
        case KeyEvent.VK_LEFT:
            dx = -5;
            break;
        case KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT:
            dx = +5;
            break;
    }
}
\end{code}

In \java{keyPressed}, we change \java{dx} or \java{dy} depending on which key is currently being pressed.
Similarly, the \java{keyReleased} method changes \java{dx} or \java{dy} back to zero.

\begin{code}
public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
    switch (e.getKeyCode()) {
        case KeyEvent.VK_UP:
        case KeyEvent.VK_DOWN:
            dy = 0;
            break;
        case KeyEvent.VK_LEFT:
        case KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT:
            dx = 0;
            break;
    }
}
\end{code}

We don't really need the \java{keyTyped} method for this example.
But it's required by the interface; if we don't provide one, the compiler will complain.

\begin{code}
public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
    // do nothing
}
\end{code}


\section{A Video Game}

We will now rewrite the \java{main} method from Section~\ref{sec:blinking} to demo a \java{Sprite} that responds to keyboard input.
This program can be the start of a video game that you extend by adding other actors and event listeners.

In order for an object to receive keyboard events, it needs to be added as a key listener where the typing will occur.
We will need the following lines:

\begin{code}
Sprite sprite = new Sprite("face-smile.png", 25, 150);
drawing.add(sprite);
drawing.addKeyListener(sprite);
drawing.setFocusable(true);
\end{code}

Recall that the \java{add} method is one that we wrote in Section~\ref{sec:drawing}.
It adds an \java{Actor} to the list of objects to be drawn.
The \java{addKeyListener} method is provided by \java{Component}, the superclass of \java{Canvas}.
It adds \java{sprite} to the list of objects that will receive key events.

In graphical applications, key events are only sent to components when they have the keyboard focus.
The \java{setFocusable} method ensures that \java{drawing} will be have the focus initially, without the user having to click on it first.

%When you run this program, the arrow keys might not work initially.
%If that happens, click on the drawing to give it the keyboard focus.

Now that you know about interfaces and events, we can show you a better way to create animations.
Previously, we implemented the animation loop using \java{while (true)} and \java{Thread.sleep}.
Java provides a \java{Timer} class (in \java{javax.swing}) that encapsulates this behavior.

A \java{Timer} is useful for executing code at regular intervals.
The constructor for \java{Timer} takes two parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \java{int delay} {\tt ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} \java{// milliseconds between events}

\item \java{ActionListener listener} {\tt ~} \java{// for handling timer events}
\end{itemize}

The \java{ActionListener} interface requires only one method, \java{actionPerformed}, that is invoked by the timer.
We can reorganize the code in \java{main} by defining a class that implements \java{ActionListener}.

\begin{code}
public class VideoGame implements ActionListener {
    private Drawing drawing;
    private Toolkit toolkit;

    public VideoGame() {
        Sprite sprite = new Sprite("face-smile.png", 50, 50);
        drawing = new Drawing(800, 600);
        drawing.add(sprite);
        drawing.addKeyListener(sprite);
        drawing.setFocusable(true);
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Video Game");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.add(drawing);
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
        toolkit = frame.getToolkit();
    }

    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        drawing.step();
        toolkit.sync();  // useful for animation
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VideoGame game = new VideoGame();
        Timer timer = new Timer(25, game);
        timer.start();
    }
}
\end{code}

The \java{main} method first constructs a \java{VideoGame} object, which sets up all the graphical elements.
It then constructs a \java{Timer} object that will send action events every 25 milliseconds to \java{game}.
And finally, it starts the timer.

We hope this final chapter has been a helpful summary of topics presented throughout the book, including input and output, decisions and loops, classes and methods, arrays and objects, inheritance, and graphics.
Congratulations on making it to the end!
